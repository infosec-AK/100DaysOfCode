# 100DaysOfCode

To back my networking, security and systems admin knowledge, I decided to hone my skills in coding and so I took up 100 Days of Code challenge in python.
I started my 100 days journey on October 7, 2022.
I am creating this repository to track my progress and add scripts along the way.
